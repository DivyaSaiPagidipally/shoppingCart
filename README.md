**You are tasked with building a shopping cart system for an online store. The system should allow customers to add products to their cart, remove products from their cart, update quantities of products in their cart, get the list of items in their cart, calculate the total price of all items in their cart, empty their cart, and search for products in their cart based on their name.**

The shopping cart system should have the following functionalities:

*Add a product to the cart with the specified quantity.*
*Remove a product from the cart.*
*Update the quantity of a product in the cart.*
*Get the list of items currently in the cart.*
*Calculate the total price of all items in the cart.*
*Empty the cart.*
*Search for products in the cart based on their name.*

The system should be implemented using TypeScript. The system should also handle cases where multiple items of the same product are added to the cart and allow for searching products in a case-insensitive manner.
